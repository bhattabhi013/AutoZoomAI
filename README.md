<h3 align="center">AutoZoom AI</h3>
AutoZoom AI is a Flutter application that uses machine learning and computer vision to detect objects in the camera's field of view and automatically zoom in on them. This feature can be useful for users who have difficulty seeing objects that are far away or who want to focus on a particular object in a crowded environment.
